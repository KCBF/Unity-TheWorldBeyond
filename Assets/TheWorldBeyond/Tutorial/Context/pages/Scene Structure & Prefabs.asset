    The main scene in The
    World Beyond is "TheWorldBeyond.unity," containing the core experience. This
    scene should be the only one in the Build settings. Most content in this scene
    is pre-existing, meaning the system doesn''t spawn it at runtime. Exceptions
    include the virtual room (visible through the flashlight), Passthrough walls,
    and ground grass in your room. Other notes about the scene include:


    * *NavMesh:*
    Oppy walks on this, and it lives under the Environment/EnvRoot object. *NavMesh*
    is part of the Unity Editor. The scene adds obstacles dynamically (e.g., your
    room walls, furniture, and trees/rocks in the foreground).

    * [*WorldBeyondManager:*](../Assets/TheWorldBeyond/Scripts/GameManagement/WorldBeyondManager.cs)
    Holds the *WorldBeyondManager* component, managing the whole demo. Consider *WorldBeyondManager*
    as the `main()` function.

    * [*MultiToy:*](../Assets/TheWorldBeyond/Scripts/Toy/MultiToy.cs)
    You can attach *MultiToy* to your hand/controller. Only one MultiToy will ever
    exist, and you can attach it to either hand.

    * *Oppy:* Everything related
    to Oppy is in *Oppy*.

    * *Environment:* Everything in the virtual world,
    except the UFO, is included in *Environment*.
