# The World Beyond

The World Beyond is a Mixed Reality (MR) project that demonstrates key MR features and how to integrate them into your project using the Presence Platform features.

This codebase serves as a reference and template for MR projects. You can test the experience on [App Lab - The World Beyond](https://www.meta.com/experiences/the-world-beyond/4873390506111025/).

## Project Description

This project showcases the Scene API, Passthrough, Voice SDK, Interaction SDK, and Audio Spatializer features.

Built using the [Unity engine](https://unity.com/) with Unity 6000.0.50f1 or higher, it includes the MRUK (Mixed Reality Utility Kit) package, which provides useful tools and methods for mixed reality experiences.

## How to Run the Project in Unity

1. Use Unity 6000.0.50f1 or higher.
2. Load the [TheWorldBeyond.unity](./Assets/TheWorldBeyond/Scenes/TheWorldBeyond.unity) scene.
3. To test in the Editor, use Quest Link:
    <details>
      <summary><b>Quest Link</b></summary>

    - Enable Quest Link:
        - Put on your headset, go to "Quick Settings", and select "Quest Link" (or "Quest Air Link" if using Air Link).
        - Select your desktop from the list, then select "Launch". This opens the Quest Link app, allowing desktop control from your headset.
    - With the headset on, select "Desktop" from the control panel in front of you. You should see your desktop in VR.
    - Navigate to Unity and press "Play"; the application should launch on your headset automatically.
    - **Note**: For Scene API, room data must exist before connecting the device; disconnect Link, run Room Setup on your Quest, then reconnect Link.

4. For Mac users: Build an APK and deploy it to your device.
