# Voice Integration

In The World Beyond, the system unlocks Voice control after opening a wall to the virtual world; Oppy listens to you when you gaze at her. For detailed instructions on using the Voice SDK, follow the [developer documentation](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/voice-sdk-overview/). Examples of using the Voice SDK in The World Beyond:

* *Reaction:* Play an animation on Oppy (hi, jump) or perform a behavior (come). See [`WitConnector.WitResponseReceiver()`](../Assets/TheWorldBeyond/Scripts/Wit/WitConnector.cs#L165) for more information.
* *Transcription:* See the results of your command in Oppy's speech bubble. See [`WitConnector.LiveTranscriptionHandler()`](../Assets/TheWorldBeyond/Scripts/Wit/WitConnector.cs#L187) for more information.
